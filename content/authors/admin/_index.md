Hi, this is Sunny! I was born and raised in a beautiful country called Taiwan. :heart: As a student in National Taiwan University, I double majored in Physics and Forestry Conservation. During my MSc.in University of British Columbia, I continued pursuing my passion in developing mathematical methods for conservation ecology, specifically focusing on avian acoustic data. Now a happy PhD student living in a city with latitude of 54&deg;N.




When I am not sitting in the office, you can often find me being outside recordings bird sounds, swimming, reading, writing, or staying home drawing.
