Hi, this is Sunny! I was born and raised in a beautiful country called Taiwan. :heart: Growing up, I see myself as a multidisciplinary individual - I am a scientist, a writer, an artist, and a field recordist. Exploring this world with great enthusiasm and self-reflection is the way I guide my life. When I am not in the office, you can often find me outside hiking, recording, swimming (scuba diving), or simply staying home enjoying a cup of tea.

Now a happy Ph.D. student living in a city with latitude of 54&deg;N in Canada.
