Forests in interior British Columbia (BC), Canada are naturally maintained by wildfires; however, wildfire characteristics in interior BC have been shifting with climate change, where longer, warmer, and drier summers may alter the existing fire regimes. For this, resources have been devoted to developing and applying innovative post-fire management strategies, in order to lower the probability of subsequent fire events and/or lower the severity of subsequent fires. This study aims to determine whether and how the severity of previous fire influenced the reburn severity in the Riske Creek are in interior BC, and provide insights into developing post-fire management strategies, in order to lower the probability of reburn and/or lower the reburn severity.
