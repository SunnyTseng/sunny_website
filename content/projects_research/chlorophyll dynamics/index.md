Chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) is a key indicator to study plant physiology or photosynthesis efficiency. Conventionally, CF is characterized by fluorometers, which only allows ensemble measurement through wide-field detection. Here we demonstrated a fluorometer based on confocal imaging, that not only provides high contrast images, but also allows CF measurement with spatiotemporal resolution as high as micrometer and millisecond. Confocal imaging fluorometers provide micrometer and millisecond CF characterization, opening up unprecedented possibilities toward detailed spatiotemporal analysis of CF transients and its propagation dynamics, as well as photosynthesis efficiency analysis, on the scale of organelles, in a living plant.
